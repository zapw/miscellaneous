write script to:
 scan for empty dirs so later add rule to skip them:
	find -type d -empty

dirs only with a Makefile
find . -type f -name Makefile -execdir bash -c 'shopt -s nullglob ; entries=(*); ((${#entries[@]} == 1)) && echo $PWD/{}'  \;

dirs with no source files or Makefile
for i in */ ; do { printf "%s\n" $i/* |  grep -q -E -v '(\.c(pp)?$|Makefile)' ;} && echo $i ; done

only specified dirs:
exclude these dirs
dirs=$(printf "%s\n" */|egrep -v '(CeqTests|SecurityTests|src)' )

 so later add rule to skip them

dirs with content but no Makefile and no other subdirs
 so later add rule to skip them

dirs with content but no Makefile but with more content
 so later add rule to skip them

dirs with content that isn't more dirs and Makefile
dirs with content that is more dirs and Makefile
