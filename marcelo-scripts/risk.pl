#enter desired risk percent
#0 not allowed negative not allowed

#enter new percent


#enter current position

#if new percenet negative or 0 reprompt

#if new percent larger than old percent than use decrese formula 
#if new percent smaller than old percent than use increase formula

#long or short
#enter current holding position

#if position negative and long add (ereh muhlat) of negative position plus calculated position after formula - update stop loss equal to new calculated position after formula
#if position positive and long add (ereh muhlat) of position plus calculated position after foruma - update stop loss equal to ereh muhlat of position plus calculated position after formula


#if position zero and long add calculated position after formula - update stop loss equal to calcualted position after formula

#if position negative and short decrese of negative position by calculated position after formula - update stop loss equal to ( ereh muhlat of of position plus calculated position after formula ) 
#if position positive and short decrease by current positive position plus calculated position after formula - update stop loss to equal to new calculated position after formula 
#if position zero and short decrese position after formula - update stop loss equal to calculated position after formula
